Short End of the Stick
Jack of All Trades Master of None
Drive Me Nuts
A Chip on Your Shoulder
Right Out of the Gate
Tug of War
Goody Two-Shoes
Give a Man a Fish
Fit as a Fiddle
Under Your Nose
Back to Square One
In a Pickle
Under the Weather
There's No I in Team
If You Can't Stand the Heat, Get Out of the Kitchen
Know the Ropes
Hit Below The Belt
Money Doesn't Grow On Trees
You Can't Teach an Old Dog New Tricks
Go Out On a Limb
Flea Market
Not the Sharpest Tool in the Shed
Head Over Heels
Like Father Like Son
Par For the Course
